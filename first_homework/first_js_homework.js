// FOR LOOP CONTROL PANEL
// A for loop performs the same operation as a while loop. But what are the key differences, if any? What are the similarities?
// it's shorter and the variables are self contained. both set a variable, modifier, and a formula to run when true.

// What are the three components of the control panel? Each component is separated by a semicolon ;.
//"for" loop declares the initial variable, sets the condition, and gives the formula to change the variable

// "\" says to ignore the next character's function. Without "\" the ' would be considered as a closing mark and it would break the string.

// they do the same thing
